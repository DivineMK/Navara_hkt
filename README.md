🔎 The challenge:  forest rangers of Natuurmonumenten monitor all kinds of animal species, but this is still often done with pen and paper. This can be done faster and smarter. You will work with your team to develop an app that allows forest rangers to enter data directly in the field: from spotting animal species to recording locations and numbers.

🐾 Your mission: Help Natuurmonumenten modernize their nature management. Develop an app that makes counting animal species, analyzing populations, and registering nuisance easier and more efficient. Together we will harmonize this registration, so that forest rangers and ecologists gain more insight into nature management in the Netherlands.

# Plan

- Quick recording of species, locations (with GPS), and population counts. Add notes and upload photos.
- Enable data entry when offline, with sync functionality when back online.
- Visualize sightings and hotspots on a map. Generate simple analytics (e.g., population trends, distribution patterns).
- Auto-suggest species names from a database to reduce errors <- YOLO.
- Record incidents like invasive species or damaged habitats.
